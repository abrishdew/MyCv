<p class="title">Relative length unit? Or not.</p>
<article>
    <p>Various length units are available to describe properties like margin, padding, width, height and font size.
        They are categorized in to two groups. These are: <br> Absolute and Relative. <br> <br>
    The major differnece between the two is that Absolute length units are used to express fixed lengths
    like cm, mm, and px while Relative length units give length with relation 
    to other length units using rem(relative size to root element), em(relative size to current element)
    and %(relative to parent element).
    This makes Relative length units more ideal as they scale themselves 
    when they are rendered on browsers of different devices ranging from computers to small phones. <br> <br>
    Although the possibility of page zooming is made available on the 
            major browsers(responsive browsers) enabiling 
            the users to get a better text-size that is more big and readable which is much more 
        convienient, I presume that Relative length units should be used over Absolute length units because
        setting up the relative size could come in handy at times where we open the page on a smaller device, but if we stick with absolute 
        then we are forced to use page zoom and the user won't be able to see the 
        whole width of the content after zooming which would lead to scrolling to the right or to the left,or even scrolling up and down 
        to see the next portion content.

    <p class="title">Default Browser Width explained</p>
    <article>
    
        <p>The standard Conversion formula is 16px = 100%, this is equal to 1em.
            This means that 
           our default browser is set to 16pxs. <br> <br> Pixel is static, it is an absolute measurment.On the other
           hand percent and em are relative measurements. Percent depends on its parent font size and EM is relative to the current 
           size of the element.
<br><br>
           The browser interprets units from the cascading stylesheets doing calculation based on this 
           formula. <br>
          <em>For example</em> 
           If you haven't set the font size anywhere on the page,
            then it is the browser default, which is often 16px.
            <br> <br> So, by default 1em = 16px, and 2em = 32px. 
             If you set a font-size of 20px on the body element, then 1em = 20px and 2em = 40px.
            Note that the value 2 is essentially a multiplier of the current em size.
           If the font-size you want is 12px, 
           then you should specify 0.75em (because 12/16 = 0.75). Similarly
           for 22px, specify 1.375em (22/16).

    <p class="title">What's new with CSS3?</p>
    <article>
    
    <p>CSS3 has introduced new features to help style our HTML. Some of which are: <br> <br>
        Introduction of rounded corners through the border radius property making the css code used 
        for rounded corners lesser for the developer which can be applied to different elements like text and image.
        
        <br>
            <br>
        Multiple background images were made available to layer one over the other.

        <br>
            <br>
        Linear Gradients and Radial Gradients were also introduced for blending colors in different 
        angles for styling purposes.
        
        <br>
            <br>
        The new box shadow and text shadow effects of CSS3 enable a shadow effect to be dropped 
        around an element through a single line of code which was done by using a repeated image 
        around the element prior to CSS3.
            <br>

        <br>
        Some new selectors were introduced and these new selectors allow users to access DOM elements 
        through their attributes that eases styling.
        <br>
        <br>
        Others include addition of new colors(RGBA, HSL, HSLA, Gradient colors) and Attribute selectors 
        where developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes to apply CSS rather than 
        creating unique ID's only.  
                                    </p>
