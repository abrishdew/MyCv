<p id="name">Abraham Tesfaye</p>
<p>I am a Software Engineer graduate at the age of 23 and I have recently <br> 
    formed a personal organization called ETobya where we bring in new ideas to help our society <br> 
    and above all help our motherland Ethiopia. <br> I have also started a program called "Reality Inception" 
     where my colleagues and I go to Fountain of Knowledge School(My Highschool) where we educate <br> 
     the kids and help them lively up their selves for they have a country to prosper and they are next inline. <br>
    Aside of that I do Freelancing every now and then and I am cooperating with my partners to launch <br>
    a new app that could serve well for the Ethiopian Orthdox Tewahido Church. <br>
    Below are some of My works over the years, I hope you find them interesting!ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ</p>
