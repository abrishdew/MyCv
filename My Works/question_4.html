<p>Various length units are available to describe properties like margin, padding, width, height and font size.
    They are categorized in to two groups. These are: Absolute and Relative.
The major differnece between the two is that Absolute length units are used to express fixed lengths
like cm, mm, and px while Relative length units give length with relation 
to other length units using rem(relative size to root element), em(relative size to current element)
and %(relative to parent element). 
This makes Relative length units more ideal as they scale themselves 
when they are rendered on browsers of different devices ranging from computers to small phones.
Although the possibility of page zooming is made available on the 
        major browsers(responsive browsers) enabiling 
        the users to get a better text-size that is more big and readable which is much more 
    convienient, I presume that Relative length units should be used over Absolute length units because
    Setting up the relative size could come in handy at times where we open the page on a smaller device,but if we stick with absolute 
    then we are forced to use page zoom and The user won't be able to see the 
    whole width of the content after zooming which would lead to scrolling to the right or to the left,or even scrolling up and down 
    to see the next portion.
