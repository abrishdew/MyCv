                CSS3 has introduced new features to help style our HTML.Some of which are: <br> <br>
                Introduction of rounded corners through the border radius property making the css code used 
                for rounded corners lesser for the developer which can be applied to different elements like text and image.
                
                <br>
                    <br>
                Multiple background images were made available to layer one over the other.

                <br>
                    <br>
                Linear Gradients and Radial Gradients were also introduced for blending colors in different 
                angles for styling purposes.
                
                <br>
                    <br>
                Th new box shadow and text shadow effects of CSS3 enable a shadow effect to be dropped 
                around an element through a single line of code which was done by using a repeated image 
                around the element prior to CSS3.

                <br>
                Some new selectors were introduced and these new selectors allow users to access DOM elements 
                through their attributes that eases styling.
                <br>
                Others include Addition of new colors(RGBA, HSL, HSLA, Gradient colors) and Attribute selectors where 
                developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes to apply css rather than 
                creating unique ID's only.
